### Values to report

A character string containing only elements of "v", "c", "s","t", "p", "\*" that determines whether, and in which order, variable names ("v"), coefficients ("c"), standard errors/confidence intervals ("s"), test statistics ("t") and p-values ("p") should be reported in regression tables. If one of the aforementioned letters is followed by an asterisk ("\*"), significance stars will be reported next to the corresponding statistic.

Ex: "vct\*"
